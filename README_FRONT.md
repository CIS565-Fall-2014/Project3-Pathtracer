CIS 565 Project 3: CUDA Pathtracer
==================================

#### Michael Li

[Text overview, some pictures.]






### Details on what I implemented

##### getRandomPointOnSphere()

Used:

* http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SpherePointPicking.html
* http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/SphericalCoords.aspx


##### boxIntersectionTest()

Makes use of a helper function "planeIntersectionTest()". I've implemented this
stuff in CIS 560 before so the code is being reused here.

See:
