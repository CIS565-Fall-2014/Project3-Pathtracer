White points on diffuse sphere: Russian to eliminate diffuse less than 0.2
Fresnel: c1 maybe less than zero

One white line appear just in front of the light
And it disappears when I add currdepth to random seed;

Some white spots appears after 2000 iterations: 
solve int seed = index * time *(currdepth + 1);  to int seed = index * (time + currdepth + 1);

final: index * (time/2 + currdepth);


transinverseTransform to get right normal for obj
