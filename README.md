CIS 565 Project3 : CUDA Pathtracer
===================

Fall 2014

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
For this project, I implemented a pathtracer on Nvidia GPU by using CUDA so that the rendering process is very fast.

## FEATURES
basic features:
* Raycasting from a camera into a scene through a pixel grid
* Diffuse surfaces
* Perfect specular reflective surfaces
* Cube&Sphere intersection testing
* Sphere surface point sampling
* Stream compaction optimization 
* 

additional features:
* Depth of field
* Fresnel Refraction and Reflection
* Supersampled antialiasing
* Motion blur
